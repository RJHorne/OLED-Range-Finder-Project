# OLED-Range-Finder-Project

In this exercise we will take the Ultrasonic ranger project PCB, and by removing the ultrasonic sensor module and replacing it with a temperature/humidity sensor together with some modifications to the code we will convert the project to a digital thermometer.

You will need the following items.

OLED range finder PCB completed and working.
Mini USB lead
DHT11 Temperature and humidity sensor
Laptop or desktop computer with Arduino IDE installed, Windows or Mac either are acceptable.
Please ensure you follow the steps below in the following order.

1. Unplug the project PCB from the computer to remove power.
2. Unplug the Ultrasonic sensor.
3. Plug the project PCB into the computer with a mini USB lead.
4. Open the Arduino software, select the Com port, select the Nano and Microcontroller, install libraries.
5. Copy and paste the new code into the Arduino software
6. Copy the file UKCLOGO.h into the same folder, compile and upload.
7. Unplug the project PCB from the computer to remove power.
8. Plug the new DHT11 sensor into the project PCB.
9. Plug the project PCB into the computer with a mini USB lead.
